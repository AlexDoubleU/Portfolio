          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Tech Cowboy is a shooter built in UE5 with a top-down view. It has fast-paced combat featuring waves of enemies, with breaks for upgrading your abilities.</p>

          <p>My role in the project was game designer and programmer. I handled the majority of the gameplay design (80%) and almost all of the programming (95%). </p>

          <p>This was the first game jam that I worked on and I had a lot of fun working through problems and various challenges that came up during development.</p>

          <div class ="panel">
            <p>I handled the majority of the gameplay from the upgrade system, enemy behaviours to player movement and abilities.</p>

            <p>After fighting a wave of enemies, player's can choose to upgrade a part of their arsenal, such as piercing shot or the ability to use the laser ability which slows time. There's also a shield that protects you and stat increases like ammo and reload time.</p>
            <p>I was hoping to add more to the game in terms of abilities and other ways to fight enemies, as the shooting gameplay on its own can feel boring at times, but time constraints from the game jam made it difficult to create a lot of variety.</p>

            </div>

            <p>I also maintained a design log throughout development that contained all the design choices and discussions that we had, this was done on Google Docs and laid out in a way where the newer discussions and notes were near the top, and older things such as the game's concept were at the very bottom.</p>

            <p>In the screenshot below is a part of the design log showing some of the initial concept stage and the first day's notes regarding our prototype. We could also comment on any part of the log and have a discussion in the comments feature of docs before resolving it and adding to the log.</p>

            <p>This was the first time I decided to do a design log like this for a project and it turned out pretty well, we were able to document all the discussions and decisions we made so it would be easy to see how we got to where we are if a new dev joined.</p>

            </div>

            <p>We also kept track of tasks by using trello, I don't have any screenshots of it during use but I can show an example of what was put in the "Done" list.</p>
